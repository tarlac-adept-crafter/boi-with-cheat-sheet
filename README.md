# BOI Launch Script with Cheat Sheet

Are there too many items to keep track of in The Binding of Isaac (BOI)? Same.

This script opens 
[the Isaac Cheat Sheet from Platinum God](https://platinumgod.co.uk/) 
in your default browser and launches BOI through Steam!

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10\*
- Steam
- BOI through Steam

\* This script has only been tested on Windows 10, but it should work on 
Windows 7. I have no clue if it will work on anything older than that, but 
please let me know if you find out!

## Usage

1. Download this repository (or just copy/paste the raw script text into your
  own script file).
3. Copy/cut/paste the `boi_platinum_god.bat` script to wherever you want it.
4. Double-click the script. Your default browser should open 
  https://platinumgod.co.uk and BOI should launch through Steam.
  
### Optional

- Create a Desktop shortcut to the script. You can also put the 
  script directly on your Desktop.
- Rename the script/shortcut.
- Change the script or shortcut icon. 
    - To do this, right-click the script/shortcut, click "Properties". Under
      the "Shortcut" tab, click "Change Icon...", click "OK" on the window 
      about no icons in the current file appears, and "Browse..." for an icon.
    - Steam game icons are usually stored in `path/to/Steam/steam/games`. The
      game executable will also usually have an icon you can select.
